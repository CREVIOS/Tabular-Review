# Fix type error in code (2025-06-20 19:04:48)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument of type 'string | null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number | boolean'.
  Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string | number | boolean'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the error, the issue is that `localStorage.getItem('auth_token')` can return `null`, but `encodeURIComponent()` doesn't accept `null` values.

Here's a concise fix using the nullish coalescing operator:

---

```diff
          const token = localStorage.getItem('auth_token')
          const eventSource = new EventSource(
-             `http://localhost:8000/api/reviews/${reviewId}/stream?token=${encodeURIComponent(token)}`
+             `http://localhost:8000/api/reviews/${reviewId}/stream?token=${encodeURIComponent(token ?? '')}`
            );
          
```

---

The fix uses the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to provide an empty string fallback when the auth token is null. This ensures `encodeURIComponent()` always receives a string value, resolving the TypeScript error.

make review  the data columns to wrap texts after a width, show only a single line, remove showing the source in cell, but show them in hovering, also i need to scroll the table in down properly, make the table centered, justified, and proper @review-table
